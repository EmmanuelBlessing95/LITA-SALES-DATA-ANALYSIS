## Introduction

This is the LITA's sales Performance analysis project. I am tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. I will be exploring sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlight key insight to the Sales Performance data.

### Data Sources

This data was given to me to work on in my Ladies in Tech Academy class with Incubator Hub. The data had 8 columns and 50001 rows. 

### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis.
- SQL(Structured Query Language) for querying data.
- Power Bi for Data Visualisation.
- GitHub for portfolio building.

## Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel

### Data Preparation

 1. The dataset was loaded into Microsoft Excel.
 2. The data has duplicate and no missing values.
 3. I created an extra column for Sales/Revenue by multiplying my Quantity by UnitPrice.

### Key Questions

1. Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize
total sales by product, region, and month.
