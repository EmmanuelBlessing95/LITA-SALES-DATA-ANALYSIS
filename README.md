## Introduction

This is the LITA's sales Performance analysis project. I am tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. I will be exploring sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlight key insight to the Sales Performance data.

### Data Sources

This data was given to me to work on in my Ladies in Tech Academy class with Incubator Hub. The data had 8 columns and 50001 rows. 

### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis.
- SQL(Structured Query Language) for querying data.
- Power Bi for Data Visualisation.
- GitHub for portfolio building.

## Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel

### Data Preparation

 1. The dataset was loaded into Microsoft Excel.
 2. The data has duplicate and no missing values.
 3. I created an extra column for Sales/Revenue by multiplying my Quantity by UnitPrice.

### Key Questions

1. Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize
total sales by product, region, and month.

2. Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and
total revenue by region.

## Data Analysis using SQL

### Data Preparation
1. I created a Salesdata Table.
2. I then immported my Salesdata csv file into my database(ProgreSQL)
3. Before importing, i ensured the data types were right, no null value, consistency of data.

 ## Data Visualisation using Power Bi

 ### Data Preparation

 1. I connected my datasource to powerbi and transform on power query.
 2. I remove duplicate data and ensure data validation and consistency.
 3. I then loaded to PowerBI.
 4. I created some measures for my analysis.
    
### Key Questions

- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.
